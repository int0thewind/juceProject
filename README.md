# Tutorial: Build a MIDI synthesiser

A follow up of the JUCE official tutorial: [Build a MIDI synthesiser](https://docs.juce.com/master/tutorial_synth_using_midi_input.html).

## Notes

A synthesiser object in JUCE handles several synthesiser voice and synthesiser sound. 
A synthesiser voice can only belong to a synthesiser, but the synthesiser sound is managed by the developer.
